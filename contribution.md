# Contribution in TESpy

## Abstract
In this work the further development of the exergy analysis module in TESpy is shown.
Until now, just the calculations of the pyhsical exergy is implemented in the official TESpy library.
In recent projects the extension by the chemical exergy anaylsis was made and partially validated.
For this reason, the results of the exergy calculations are compared and fully validated. Moreover, 
the Sankey diagram, which shows all different exergy flows within or oustide the systems' boundary, is adapted. In other words,
the Sankey diagram can differentiate between chemical and physical exergy.

## Deveolpment steps

### Communication with maintainer
In a past project about the analysis of the partial load efficiency of heat pumps, me and the maintainer of TESpy already worked together.
For this reason, we discussed which are useful projects for further developments. In conclusion, the validation and the 
adaption of the Sankey diagram for the chemical exergy calculations are chosen as development goals.
